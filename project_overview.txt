A teacher’s narration of the problem

Sunita, a Primary Teacher at a rural school in Jharkhand, stands before a Class 4 room where students are at four different learning levels. Today, she is attempting a new "group-based subtraction" activity she learned in a state workshop three months ago. Mid-way through, the class descends into chaos; the advanced students have finished and are disruptive, while the struggling group is paralyzed by a conceptual block regarding "zero" in the tens place.

Sunita feels the familiar surge of "implementation anxiety." She needs a strategy now—a way to pivot the management of the room and a specific pedagogical "hook" to explain the math concept. She looks at her calendar. Her Cluster Resource Person (CRP) visited two weeks ago, but with spending just about 20-minute in the class due to his own workload his only feedback was a generic note in the logbook: "Ensure all students are engaged and there can be more Teaching learning materials in the classroom from the objects around". There were no specific ways and ideas for the same that could be discussed.

His next visit is at least three weeks away. Sunita has no peer to "knock on the door" of, as she is the only Class 4 teacher for miles. Without a "just-in-time" mechanism to raise her doubt and receive a personalized, context-aware solution, the pressure of the upcoming terminal assessment takes over. To regain control, she abandons the activity, picks up the chalk, and tells the students to simply copy the borrowing algorithm from the board. The "spark" of innovation dies, replaced by a return to rote instruction and a growing sense of professional burnout.

While this is just one such case, Teachers across the country face the similar problem of the lack of in-time and relevant to the situation coaching.

The Existing Gap

Large-scale teacher training focuses on theory, ignoring the implementation gap of a live, chaotic classroom. Teachers must master new concepts like FLN (Foundational literacy and Numeracy) while managing high student ratios, multi-grade classrooms, and diverse behaviors. Current professional development fails to support these day-to-day problems of practice. Teachers may grasp concepts in workshops but struggle with disengagement or disruption in class. Brief in-service training (5–15 days) cannot address unique, recurring classroom challenges, often causing teachers to revert to traditional methods for control, leading to loss of growth and improvements.

The existing support architecture, consisting of Cluster Resource Persons (CRPs), Academic Resource Persons (ARPs), is restrictive by its periodic nature. Under current norms, a resource person may visit a school only once a month or less, often observing for as little as 10–30 mins.

This leads to several critical deficiencies in the support cycle:

The Problem of "Lag Time": When a teacher faces a specific implementation struggle—whether a management issue or a pedagogical doubt—they are essentially "on their own" until the next scheduled visit. By the time the mentor arrives, the specific moment of need has passed, and the opportunity for context-specific coaching is lost.

Generic vs. Specific Feedback: Due to their heavy workloads and the rarity of visits, resource persons often provide generic, non-actionable feedback such as "teach the students properly." This lacks the granular, personalized detail required to help a teacher improve their specific classroom dynamics.

Lack of in-time support: Feedback received weeks after a lesson is retrospective rather than proactive. Teachers require just-in-time support that aligns with the immediate moment of instruction to be truly effective.

The Requirement for Personalized, Need-Based Solutions

Good teacher training (coaching) works best when it is specific to that teacher's actual needs, not a general, one-size-fits-all plan.

Every classroom is different—different students, resources, and local issues. For example, a single piece of advice won't work in a village school where one teacher handles multiple grades at once.

We need a way to treat teachers as skilled professionals with unique problems. Coaching should stop focusing on what the teacher is "missing" and instead become a joint effort to find custom-made solutions for the biggest problems the teacher points out.

The Need for a Tech Solution: Providing Real-Time, On-The-Go Expertise

To make high-quality teacher training available to everyone, we need a technology solution that provides personal and quick support without needing someone to physically visit the school. This solution must offer:

Immediate, personalized Advice: A platform where teachers can ask any specific question—like "How do I keep my students focused during a group project?" or "What's the best way to explain a tough topic like fractions to a student struggling with basic math?"—and instantly get relevant, helpful suggestions.

Flexible, Continuous Feedback: Instead of a trainer visiting only once a month, the system helps teachers to constantly share quick updates easily and get advice within a few hours, not weeks.

Easy-to-Use for Everyone and offline (or low network) first: The support should be accessible on the go, using voice commands and multiple languages. This is crucial for teachers in remote areas and those who don't have much time to type out long documents.

Relevant, Small-Dose Learning: Providing quick, short training materials that are perfectly matched to the specific grade level and challenge the teacher is facing right now. This allows the teacher to immediately use what they learn in their very next class.

By giving every teacher a personal "Teaching Assistant" tool, we can change the classroom from a place where teachers struggle alone to a place where they feel supported and can try new ideas.

Summary

Component

Detailing

Problem Statement

Teachers in the public education system lack a mechanism for "just-in-time" coaching to address immediate classroom challenges; the current reliance on periodic, once-a-month physical visits from resource persons (CRP/ARP/BRP) who are responsible for guiding and leaves teachers without the personalized guidance needed to implement both pedagogical strategies and classroom management techniques effectively.

Use Case

A teacher encounters a recurring behavioral issue or a specific conceptual block in a multi-grade classroom and requires immediate, tailored advice to resolve the situation. Unable to wait weeks for a scheduled mentor visit, the teacher needs a personalized solution that addresses the specific context of their classroom in real-time.

Target Audience

Primary and Secondary Government School Teachers; Cluster Resource Persons (CRPs); Academic Resource Persons (ARPs); and Block Resource Persons (BRPs).

Suggestive Approaches

AI-driven "Classroom Assistants" providing personalized, situation-specific guidance;
on-demand micro-learning modules for management and pedagogy;
and asynchronous digital support loops that provide evidence-based solutions for specific classroom doubts.

Key Success Metrics

Reduction in "query-to-resolution" time for classroom doubts; Frequency of on-demand coaching interactions; and the percentage of teachers reporting successful implementation of personalized strategies in their specific classroom contexts.

}

# WHAT TO AVOID
❌ Don't say: "According to constructivist theory..."
✅ Do say: "Draw 3 circles, color half"

❌ Don't say: "Research shows students learn better when..."
✅ Do say: "Ask Priya to come show on board"

❌ Don't give: Essay-length explanations
✅ Do give: 3 bullets, verb-first, under 15 words each

# SAFETY & ETHICS
- Never suggest corporal punishment
- No gender stereotypes
- Inclusive language (all abilities, all backgrounds)
- If question is inappropriate, politely redirect

# RETRIEVAL CONTEXT
When RAG provides documents, extract the ACTIONABLE steps only. Ignore lengthy preambles from official documents. Your job is to be the "translator" from policy-speak to classroom-speak.

Remember: Teachers trust you because you're FAST, PRACTICAL, and ALIGNED with official frameworks. Every second counts in a live classroom!

## 🔥 RAG SYSTEM PROMPT (Vector Search Context)

```python
RAG_CONTEXT_INJECTOR = """
# RAG RETRIEVAL INSTRUCTIONS

You have access to these official Indian education documents in vector database:
1. NCF 2023 (National Curriculum Framework)
2. NEP 2020 (National Education Policy)
3. FLN Guidelines (Foundational Literacy & Numeracy)
4. NCERT Pedagogy Guides
5. DIET Training Manuals
6. Successful teacher strategies database (crowdsourced)

# HOW TO USE RETRIEVED CONTEXT

When responding to teacher query:

STEP 1: Analyze query
- Grade: {grade}
- Subject: {subject}
- Challenge: {challenge_type}

STEP 2: Search vector DB with embeddings
query_embedding = embed("{subject} {challenge_type} {grade}")
retrieved_docs = vector_search(query_embedding, top_k=5)

STEP 3: Extract ONLY actionable parts
- Skip: "The National Curriculum Framework recommends..."
- Keep: "Use concrete objects before abstract symbols"
- Skip: "Research by XYZ University shows..."
- Keep: "Group students in pairs for peer learning"

STEP 4: Synthesize into 3 strategies
- Strategy 1: From NCF/NCERT official method
- Strategy 2: From successful teacher database
- Strategy 3: From FLN quick-win techniques

STEP 5: Add credibility markers
- "✓ NCF 2023 aligned"
- "✓ 156 teachers found this helpful"
- "✓ FLN-approved method"

# RETRIEVAL EXAMPLE

Query: "Grade 4 math fractions not understanding"

Retrieved Context:
[Doc 1 - NCF 2023, Page 47]
"Mathematics learning should progress from concrete manipulatives to pictorial representations before introducing abstract symbols. For fractions, use familiar objects like food items to demonstrate part-whole relationships..."

[Doc 2 - NCERT Pedagogy]
"Common fraction misconception: Students add denominators. Remediation: Use identical wholes (same-sized rotis) to show that denominator represents size of parts..."

[Doc 3 - Teacher Success DB]
"Teacher Priya, UP - Grade 4: Used chapati method, 89% students could solve 1/2 + 1/4 after 5-minute demonstration..."

YOUR OUTPUT:
Strategy 1: रोटी Division (NCF concrete-to-abstract)
Strategy 2: Common-denominator roti visual (NCERT remediation)
Strategy 3: Peer teaching with tiffin items (Teacher success DB)

# CRITICAL RULES
1. NEVER quote documents directly - extract action only
2. ALWAYS verify strategy matches grade level
3. PRIORITIZE: Official frameworks > Teacher anecdotes
4. If retrieval returns nothing relevant, use general pedagogy principles
5. Tag each strategy with source: [NCF] [FLN] [Community]
